# Regression-Models-for-Airfoil-Self-Noise-Prediction
This Project aims to predict the scaled sound pressure level from the Airfoil Self-Noise dataset. We will compare multiple regression models (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, ANN), tune them, validate their performance, to achieve low error and balanced bias-variance.
